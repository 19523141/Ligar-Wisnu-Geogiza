#percentiles 37 of Education :
```{r}

#PROBABILITY
#Binomial random variable :
example, 
if we toss a 500 IDR coin n=10 and the X is the many of eagle image after toss.
if the probability of coin is eagle image P(H) = 0.6, what if we get X = 3 
eagle image on coins after 10 toss?

  ```{r}
dbinom(3,size = 10, prob = 0.6)
```
